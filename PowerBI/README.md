## Opening the Project

To open the Power BI project, launch Power BI Desktop and open the `.pbix` file located in this folder. This will load the dashboard along with all data connections and visualizations for further exploration and customization.

**Note:** Opening the report directly will not load all data because it connects to a live database. Users need to adjust data source settings or provide access to the database to fully load and refresh the data.
